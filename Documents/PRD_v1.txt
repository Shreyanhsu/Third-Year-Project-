Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Title

Similarity-Based Pre-Post Instagram Analytics for New Creators

1. Product Overview
1.1 Product Name (Working)

Content Similarity–Based Performance Guidance Tool
(Final branding to be decided later)

1.2 Problem Statement

Most Instagram analytics tools require historical data from the user in order to generate insights.

This creates a major gap:

New creators have little or no posting history

Existing tools cannot answer:

“How might this post perform?”

“What should I improve before posting?”

“What does similar content usually get?”

As a result, newcomers:

Post blindly

Copy viral creators without context

Receive analytics only after failure

1.3 Product Vision

To help new and early-stage creators make evidence-based posting decisions before publishing, by showing how similar content has performed historically across comparable creators.

This product does not predict virality.
It provides context, ranges, and improvement guidance grounded in real data.

2. Goals & Non-Goals
2.1 Goals

Provide pre-post analytics for creators with little or no history

Use content similarity, not follower count alone

Show ranges and patterns, not exact predictions

Help users understand:

What similar posts achieved

What top posts did differently

How to improve their draft content

2.2 Non-Goals

This product will not:

Predict exact views or engagement

Claim to understand Instagram’s ranking algorithm

Guarantee growth or virality

Replace full analytics tools for established creators

3. Target Users
3.1 Primary Users

New Instagram creators

Creators restarting in a new niche

Small creators (<10k followers)

Content marketers validating ideas before posting

3.2 Secondary Users (Later)

Agencies testing content ideas

Brand teams evaluating creative concepts

Educators teaching social media strategy

4. Core Concept
4.1 Key Insight

If we cannot analyze your history, we can analyze history of similar content.

The system uses:

A curated dataset of posts from multiple creators

Content similarity matching (topic, intent, structure)

Performance distributions instead of point predictions

5. Data Foundation
5.1 Dataset Characteristics (Initial)

Content type: Instagram Reels

Creators: 5 creators

Posts per creator: Few hundred

Same content category / niche

Data includes:

Views, likes, comments, shares

Caption & hashtags

Content topic & intent

Comment sentiment (sampled)

Posting time & date

5.2 Why This Dataset Is Sufficient for V1

Focused niche reduces noise

Includes successful and unsuccessful posts

Includes qualitative (content) + quantitative (metrics) signals

Enables similarity analysis without user history

6. User Input (What the User Provides)
6.1 Required Inputs

Draft caption text

Hashtags (optional but recommended)

Content category (selected or inferred)

Content format (Reel)

6.2 Optional Inputs (Later)

Target audience

Posting time (if user has one in mind)

Account size bucket (optional)

7. System Logic (High Level)
7.1 Feature Extraction (Internal)

From user input:

Topic embedding (what the post is about)

Intent classification (educate, entertain, promote, etc.)

Hashtag theme clustering

Caption structure analysis (length, hook, CTA)

7.2 Similarity Search

Compare user post against entire historical dataset

Match based on:

Topic similarity

Intent similarity

Hashtag theme overlap

Caption structure patterns

⚠️ Importantly:

Similarity search includes:

High-performing posts

Average posts

Poor-performing posts

This avoids survivorship bias.

8. Analytics & Insights Provided
8.1 Performance Ranges (Not Predictions)

The system computes:

View range (25th–75th percentile)

Engagement range

Comment sentiment distribution

Example:

“Posts most similar to yours typically received 3k–12k views.”

8.2 Comparative Analysis

From similar posts:

What top-quartile posts had

What bottom-quartile posts lacked

Examples:

Posting time patterns

Hashtag count differences

Caption hooks / CTAs presence

8.3 Improvement Guidance

Actionable suggestions:

Optimal posting time window

Hashtag themes to include or avoid

Caption structure suggestions

CTA recommendations

These suggestions are explicitly tied to observed data, not heuristics.

9. Output Philosophy (Critical)
9.1 Language Rules

The product must:

Use “tends to”, “typically”, “in similar cases”

Avoid “will”, “guaranteed”, “predicts”

9.2 Transparency

Each insight must answer:

Compared to what?

Based on how many posts?

Over what time range?

Trust is a feature.

10. UX Principles

Evidence-first, not hype-first

Clear separation between:

Observed data

Interpretation

Suggestions

Ranges and distributions over single numbers

Tooltips explaining limitations

11. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
User misinterprets range as guarantee	Clear copy + disclaimers
Dataset too small	Tight niche scoping
Bias toward large creators	Normalize metrics
Stale trends	Time-decay weighting
Overfitting similarity	Broad matching thresholds
12. Success Criteria (V1)

The product is successful if:

Users understand why insights are shown

Users can identify at least 2 concrete improvements

No user assumes guaranteed outcomes

Feedback indicates increased confidence before posting

13. Future Extensions (Explicitly Out of V1)

Multi-niche datasets

User-specific history blending

Visual content analysis (frames, audio)

Automated early-hour performance tracking

Advanced forecasting models

14. Summary

This product:

Solves a real gap for new creators

Avoids fake AI promises

Uses similarity + evidence instead of prediction

Trades certainty for clarity

It is a decision-support tool, not a fortune teller.
