Manual UI-Assisted Instagram Analytics Collection (MUI-IAC)

1. Overview
1.1 Process Name

Manual UI-Assisted Instagram Analytics Collection (MUI-IAC)

1.2 Purpose

The purpose of this process is to collect a one-time snapshot of Instagram Reel-level engagement, comment sentiment, and content context data for a small number of content creators using manual UI navigation combined with AI-assisted text extraction, without relying on:

Paid scraping tools

Automated data pipelines

Official Instagram / Meta APIs

This process is explicitly designed for:

Exploratory research

Feature analysis

Competitive or comparative studies

Early-stage product ideation

It is not intended for:

Production analytics

Recurring data pipelines

Compliance-critical reporting

Large-scale or automated scraping

2. Scope and Constraints
2.1 Scope
Dimension	Scope
Number of creators	4–5
Content type	Instagram Reels only
Data frequency	One-time snapshot
Access method	Logged-in Instagram Web UI
Data source	Explicitly visible UI elements only
2.2 Explicit Constraints
Constraint	Description
Budget	Zero (no paid tools or services)
Automation	No continuous automation or background jobs
API usage	No official Instagram / Meta APIs
Data freshness	Snapshot only (no historical backfill)
Accuracy	UI-level accuracy, manually validated
3. Data Sources
3.1 Primary Source

Instagram Web Interface

Creator profile → Reels tab

Individual reel modal pages

Reel comments view

3.2 Extraction Method

Manual navigation by human user

Screenshots for reference and validation

Comet Agent used strictly to extract explicitly visible text

⚠️ Agent constraints

No inference

No estimation

No aggregation

No fabrication of missing values

4. Data Collected
4.1 Creator-Level Metadata
Field	Description
creator_username	Instagram username
profile_url	Creator profile URL
content_type	Reels
data_collection_date	Snapshot date
4.2 Reel-Level Metrics (Per Post)
Field	Description
reel_url	Direct URL of the reel
posted_at	Timestamp shown in UI
views	Reel views
likes	Total likes
comments_count	Total comments
shares	Total shares
caption	Full reel caption
hashtags	Extracted hashtags
hashtag_count	Derived field
4.3 Comment-Level Data (Per Reel)

For each reel, extract approximately 50–100 visible comments.

Field	Description
reel_url	Associated reel
comment_text	Exact visible comment text
comment_order	Order as loaded in UI
extracted_at	Timestamp of extraction

Note: Only top / visible comments are collected. Chronological completeness is not guaranteed.

4.4 Content Understanding & Context (Derived)

These fields are derived after extraction, not during scraping.

Field	Description
post_topic	Main topic (e.g., education, entertainment, marketing, personal, meme)
post_intent	Inform, promote, entertain, react, educate, etc.
cta_present	Yes / No
visual_description	1–2 sentence factual description of what is visibly happening in the reel

⚠️ Visual descriptions must be descriptive, not interpretive.

5. Out-of-Scope Data

The following data is explicitly excluded:

Audience demographics (age, gender, location)

Historical or daily time-series metrics

Reach vs impressions breakdown

Saves (if not visible in UI)

Non-Reel content (posts, stories)

Private, hidden, or inferred metrics

6. Step-by-Step Collection Workflow
6.1 Preparation

Identify target creators (4–5 usernames)

Define structured data schema (CSV / JSON)

Prepare validation and consistency checklist

6.2 Per-Creator Collection Process
Step 1 — Profile Access

Log into Instagram manually via browser

Navigate to creator profile

Open Reels tab

Scroll until all reels are fully loaded

Step 2 — Reel Enumeration & Metrics

For each reel:

Open reel modal

Capture:

Views

Likes

Comments count

Shares

Caption

Hashtags

Use Comet Agent to extract visible text only

Step 3 — Comment Extraction

For each reel:

Click “View all comments”

Scroll until ~50–100 comments are visible

Use Comet Agent to extract exact comment text only

Do not summarize, cluster, or infer sentiment at this stage

Step 4 — Data Recording

Store data in:

CSV or

Structured JSON

Maintain:

One row per reel

One row per comment

7. Data Validation & Quality Checks
7.1 Manual Validation

Randomly verify 3–5 reels per creator:

Likes ≤ Views

Comments ≤ Likes

No duplicate reel URLs

Caption and comments match UI

7.2 Consistency Checks

Normalize numeric formats (K, M)

Convert numeric fields to integers

Validate hashtag extraction accuracy

Ensure comment text completeness

8. Data Cleaning & Processing
8.1 Tools

Python (pandas)

Manual inspection for edge cases

8.2 Processing Steps

Normalize numeric units (1.2K → 1200)

Split hashtags into arrays

Derive:

hashtag_count

engagement_rate (optional)

engagement_rate = (likes + comments_count + shares) / views

8.3 Sentiment Analysis (Post-Processing)

Run sentiment analysis on comment text using:

Rule-based or ML models (offline)

Output fields:

sentiment (positive / neutral / negative)

emotion (optional)

⚠️ Sentiment reflects commenter reaction, not overall audience sentiment.

9. Storage & Output
9.1 Storage Format

Raw data: CSV

Cleaned data: CSV or Parquet

9.2 File Naming Convention
instagram_reels_snapshot_<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv
instagram_reels_comments_<YYYY-MM-DD>.csv

10. Risks & Limitations
Risk	Mitigation
UI layout changes	One-time snapshot limits exposure
Agent extraction errors	Manual spot checks
Comment sampling bias	Clear documentation of “top comments only”
Missing reels	Full scroll verification
Policy concerns	Manual, low-volume approach
11. Ethical & Compliance Notes

Only publicly visible data is collected

No credential sharing or circumvention

No background automation

No redistribution of raw datasets

Usage limited to internal research

12. Success Criteria

The process is successful if:

All reels for selected creators are captured

50–100 comments per reel are collected (where available)

Dataset is analyzable without missing core fields

No account restrictions or platform disruptions occur

13. Future Extensions (Optional)

Transition to Instagram Graph API for owned accounts

Automated early-stage snapshotting (budget permitting)

Advanced sentiment & emotion modeling

Cross-creator content clustering and benchmarking

14. Summary

Manual UI-Assisted Instagram Analytics Collection (MUI-IAC) is a deliberately constrained, low-risk, zero-cost methodology for collecting engagement, sentiment, and content context data from Instagram Reels.

It intentionally trades:

Automation → Control

Scale → Accuracy

APIs → UI-verified truth
