ERROR HANDLING & RETRY POLICY (FINAL DESIGN)

This policy is part of your methodology. You can literally explain this in viva.

🎯 Design Principles

❌ Never retry aggressively

❌ Never loop infinitely

✅ Fail explicitly

✅ Log everything

✅ Continue scraping even if some posts fail

🔁 Retry Strategy (Simple & Safe)
Global rules

Max retries per action: 2

Retry delay: 3–5 seconds (random)

Retry scope: only the failed step, not the whole script

🧩 PHASE 1 — Error Handling (Post Indexing)
Possible failures & handling
❌ Profile not accessible

Cause: private / blocked / typo
Action:

Abort creator

Log reason

Move to next creator

{
  "creator": "abc",
  "status": "aborted",
  "reason": "profile_not_accessible"
}

❌ Reels tab not found

Cause: no reels / UI change
Action:

Abort creator

Log reason

❌ Scroll loads no new posts

Cause: end of content
Action:

Stop scrolling

Finalize index (even if <150)

❌ Collected posts < 100

Action:

Continue

Mark dataset as low_coverage: true

This is honest, not an error.

🧩 PHASE 2 — Error Handling (Post Content)
Per-post failure isolation (VERY IMPORTANT)

Each post is treated as independent.

❌ Post page fails to load

Retry: 2 times
If still fails:

Mark post as failed

Continue to next post

{
  "post_id": "C123",
  "status": "failed",
  "reason": "page_load_timeout"
}

❌ Metrics not visible

Retry: reload once
If still missing:

Save post with metrics_partial: true

Do NOT fabricate values

❌ Comments not loading

Retry: click + scroll again
If still fails:

Save post with comments_collected: 0

Mark reason

❌ Script crash / interruption

Protection:

Save data after every post

Resume from last successful index

Sequential mode makes this easy.

🧠 Why This Policy Is Strong

No hidden retries

No silent failures

Data integrity > completeness

Very easy to justify academically
